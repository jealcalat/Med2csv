""" How to use:
This function read MED raw files and writes csv files. MED files must have
the following conventions:

    1) All data should be stored in main variable {optional} as time.event.
       For example: if C is main variable, E is the counter, F is the timer and
       lever press is coded as 1, a lever press is stored in C in position E,
       C(E) = F + 0.1. If F = 120, C(E) = 120.1. Another main variable can be
       chosen, but I have only tested with C. Check variable 'a' in the function
       to see how it works the slicing from the start of C to its end.

    2) The number of columns should be specified. For example, if var cols is 5,
       which means the MED options PRINTCOLUMNS is the default, when we read a
       file with Pandas, it turns into a data frame with 6 columns. It will be
       named x1 to x6. The x1 is the column of row indexes in the raw; it'll be
       dropped. Then, the 6 cols will be stacked into two: (time, event). It
       should be easy to adapt the function to other conventions. If PRINTCOLUMNS
       is not the default (for example, is 2, which means we have a column for
       row names and a column for the data), this will produce a data frame with
       3 columns, from x1 to x3.
